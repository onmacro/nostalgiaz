# NostalgiaZ: Survivor Legacies

> Multiplayer-only survival shooter emulator inspired by the classic *Infestation: Survivor Stories* (WarZ).

NostalgiaZ is a passion project that aims to faithfully recreate and expand upon the experience of the original WarZ. Built on largely untouched source code, it restores the authentic Colorado experience while introducing modern improvements, enhanced UI, and better core systems.
